# SM-Scrapping
# Introduction
This project involves scraping Twitter data using Python to extract and analyze data from Twitter profiles. The goal is to gain insights and understand trends from the scraped data. The project utilizes the requests and pandas libraries for accessing Twitter's public APIs and processing the data efficiently.

# Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Install Python: Ensure Python is installed on your operating system (Windows/Linux).
2. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Use VS Code as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for this project.
3. Set Up Virtual Environment:
- Create a virtual environment for this project.
- Install the necessary libraries within this environment using the following commands:
pip install pandas requests
4. Get API Key from RapidAPI: Follow the steps below to obtain an API key:
- Sign up on RapidAPI.
- Search for and select a suitable Twitter API on RapidAPI.
- Subscribe to the API to obtain the API key.
- Read the API documentation to understand the available endpoints and parameters.

# Usage
1. Integrate API Key into Your Code: Include the API key in your request headers using the X-RapidAPI-Key header.
2. Construct API Requests: Use the API documentation to construct requests, specifying the appropriate URL, headers, and parameters.
3. Make API Requests: Use the requests library to send requests to the Twitter API endpoint and handle responses.
4. Handle API Responses: Check the HTTP status code and parse the response content (usually in JSON format) to extract the necessary data.
5. Process Data: Iterate through the data and perform any necessary processing.
6. Error Handling: Implement error handling to manage unsuccessful API requests.
7. Comply with Rate Limits: Ensure your code adheres to the API rate limits to avoid being blocked.
8. Monitor Usage: Keep track of your API usage and monitor for any notifications from RapidAPI.

# Features
- Data Scraping: Extract user data from Twitter profiles.
- Data Processing: Use pandas to manipulate and organize the scraped data.
- CSV Export: Save the processed data into a CSV file for further analysis.
